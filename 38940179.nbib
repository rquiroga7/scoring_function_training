AB  - MOTIVATION: In drug discovery, it is crucial to assess the drug-target binding 
      affinity (DTA). Although molecular docking is widely used, computational 
      efficiency limits its application in large-scale virtual screening. Deep 
      learning-based methods learn virtual scoring functions from labeled datasets and 
      can quickly predict affinity. However, there are three limitations. First, 
      existing methods only consider the atom-bond graph or one-dimensional sequence 
      representations of compounds, ignoring the information about functional groups 
      (pharmacophores) with specific biological activities. Second, relying on limited 
      labeled datasets fails to learn comprehensive embedding representations of 
      compounds and proteins, resulting in poor generalization performance in complex 
      scenarios. Third, existing feature fusion methods cannot adequately capture 
      contextual interaction information. RESULTS: Therefore, we propose a novel DTA 
      prediction method named HeteroDTA. Specifically, a multi-view compound feature 
      extraction module is constructed to model the atom-bond graph and pharmacophore 
      graph. The residue concat graph and protein sequence are also utilized to model 
      protein structure and function. Moreover, to enhance the generalization 
      capability and reduce the dependence on task-specific labeled data, pre-trained 
      models are utilized to initialize the atomic features of the compounds and the 
      embedding representations of the protein sequence. A context-aware nonlinear 
      feature fusion method is also proposed to learn interaction patterns between 
      compounds and proteins. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show 
      that HeteroDTA significantly outperforms existing methods. In addition, HeteroDTA 
      shows excellent generalization performance in cold-start experiments and 
      superiority in the representation learning ability of drug-target pairs. Finally, 
      the effectiveness of HeteroDTA is demonstrated in a real-world drug discovery 
      study. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and data are available at
